# Whoami

I'm a senior developer graduated from Munich UAS (Geodesy & Computer Science).

Married, two children.

If there is time left I try to learn new cool stuff.

## Job

- Member of a Scrum team
- Roles: developer, build master
- Languages: Groovy, C, Java, Java Card and Asciidoctor
- Test framework: Spock
- Build environment: Gradle, Nexus, Jenkins, Git/Bitbucket

## Interests

- cool stuff like: Kotlin, RevealJS
- somehow Rust and V (however, 24 hours per day is less time to keep up with everything...)
- favorite editors: _IntelliJ_, _Vim_, currently trying _Visual Studio Code_

## Family Project

How to feed my son with coding knowledge:

- I want him to learn _Python_ (he's got some _Scratch_ experience already).
- He wants to be a _Minecraft_ programmer instantly.
