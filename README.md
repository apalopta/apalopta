# Whoami

I'm a senior developer graduated from Munich UAS (Geodesy & Computer Science).

Married, two children.

If there is time left I try to learn new cool stuff.

## Job

- Configuration Management (after 15 years as a SmartCard OS developer and build master)
- Environment: Jenkins, Git/Bitbucket, Nexus
- Tool expert: Gradle, Bitbucket
- Languages: Groovy, Kotlin, C, Java, Java Card, Asciidoctor and others

## Interests

- cool stuff like Kotlin and Kotlin Notebooks
- last projects:
  - automated Bitbucket plugin configuration (REST API client as Gradle tasks for usage with Jenkins)
  - AOC - kind of challenging to newbies
  - tried ktor for Bitbucket queries - I think I'll never try it again with plain Groovy
- if there is time: Rust and V (days are too short...)
- favorite editors: _IntelliJ_, _Vim_, _Visual Studio Code_ isn't bad either.

## Family Project

How to feed my son with coding basics while he's keen on extending _Minecraft_...
